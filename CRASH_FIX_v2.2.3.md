# Crash Fix v2.2.3 - X-Axis Validation

## Problem
When entering invalid X-axis ranges (like 0.02 as minimum value), the app crashes and loses all progress due to:
1. Infinite loops in tick generation
2. Invalid array lengths
3. No validation before rendering

## Solution
Added comprehensive validation and error handling:

### 1. Input Validation
- Checks if Min < Max
- Checks if values are positive (> 0)
- Checks if range is not too small (< 0.001)
- Warns about very narrow log scale ranges

### 2. Improved Tick Generation
- Added loop iteration limits (max 20-100 iterations)
- Added validation for infinite values
- Added fallback tick values if generation fails
- Prevents division by zero

### 3. Error Display
Instead of crashing, the app now shows:
- Clear error messages
- Current problematic values
- Suggestions for fixing the issue
- The app continues running (no crash!)

### 4. Try-Catch Wrapper
- Entire rendering wrapped in try-catch
- Displays friendly error message if anything fails
- Lists common issues and solutions

## User Experience Improvements
1. **No More Crashes**: Invalid settings show error message instead
2. **No Data Loss**: App stays running, settings preserved
3. **Clear Feedback**: Specific error messages explain the problem
4. **Helpful Guidance**: Suggestions on how to fix issues

## Common Error Messages

### Invalid Range
"Minimum value (0.02) must be less than maximum value (0.02)"

### Values Too Small
"X-Axis range is too small. Current range: 0.000001"

### Negative or Zero Values
"X-Axis values must be positive numbers greater than 0"

### Very Narrow Log Scale
"Warning: The logarithmic scale range is very narrow"

##

 Implementation Notes
- All validations happen BEFORE attempting to render
- Validation checks are specific and actionable
- Error messages include current values for debugging
- Fallback values ensure app never completely fails

## Files Modified
- app.js: Added validation in renderForestPlot() and generateSmartTicks()

## Testing Recommendations
Test these scenarios:
1. Min = 0.02, Max = empty → Should show error
2. Min = 10, Max = 5 → Should show "min must be less than max"
3. Min = -1, Max = 10 → Should show "must be positive"
4. Min = 0, Max = 10 → Should show "must be greater than 0"
5. Min = 1, Max = 1.0001 → Should show "range too small"

All should display error messages WITHOUT crashing!
